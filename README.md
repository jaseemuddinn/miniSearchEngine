# Mini AI-Powered Search Engine

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** - This project is currently in early development stage and may contain bugs, incomplete features, and various errors. Use at your own risk.

This project is a minimal, full-stack AI-powered search engine. It features:

- **Semantic Search** using DeepSeek embeddings and ChromaDB
- **AI-Generated Summaries** for every search result
- **Smart Search Suggestions** with real-time query completion
- **Search History** with persistent storage
- **Document Upload** with automatic text processing and indexing
- **Real-time Statistics** showing indexed document count
- **Modern Frontend** with React (Vite) and responsive design
- **FastAPI Backend** with async processing and CORS support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

This project is still under active development and may experience:

- API integration issues
- Embedding model compatibility problems
- CORS and networking errors
- ChromaDB persistence issues
- DeepSeek API rate limiting
- Search suggestion accuracy issues
- Incomplete error handling
- UI/UX inconsistencies

## Project Structure

- `backend/` ‚Äî FastAPI server, semantic search logic, and ChromaDB integration
- Frontend (root) ‚Äî React app (Vite)

## Getting Started

### Backend

1. `cd backend`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set your DeepSeek API key:
   ```
   $env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "your-key-here"
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend

1. In the project root:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open the app in your browser (default: http://localhost:5173)

## Usage

### Core Features:

- **üîç Semantic Search**: Enter natural language queries and get AI-powered relevant results
- **üí° Smart Suggestions**: Get intelligent query suggestions as you type
- **üïí Search History**: Access your recent searches with one click
- **üì§ Document Upload**: Upload .txt or .md files for automatic indexing
- **üìä Live Stats**: View real-time count of indexed documents
- **ü§ñ AI Summaries**: Each result includes contextual AI-generated summaries

### Quick Start:

1. Index sample documents using the "Index Sample Documents" button
2. Try searching for terms like "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", or "neural networks"
3. Upload your own documents using the file upload feature
4. Use the search suggestions for better query ideas

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

Common problems you might encounter:

- **"DEEPSEEK_API_KEY not set"** - Make sure to set your DeepSeek API key as an environment variable
- **CORS errors** - Ensure backend is running on port 8000 and frontend on port 5173
- **ChromaDB errors** - Delete the `chroma_db` folder and restart if persistence issues occur
- **Embedding API failures** - Check your DeepSeek API key validity and rate limits
- **Frontend connection errors** - Verify backend server is running before starting frontend
